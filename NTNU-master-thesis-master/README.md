Master thesis written during the spring of 2017 as part of the course "TTK4900 Teknisk kybernetikk, masteroppgave" at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This course corresponds to a workload of 30 ECTS credits, equivalent to an entire semester workload. The master thesis is titled "Robotic rehabilitation of upper-limb after stroke" and is a continuation of my work in a prior project thesis with the same title.
